## Welcome!

Hi, I’m **Aisha Waggeh** — an MPH Candidate in Epidemiology at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health with a certificate in **Applied Biostatistics & Data Science**.  

I’m passionate about leveraging **real-world evidence (RWE)** and **machine learning** to uncover insights that improve **drug safety**, **metabolic health**, and **chronic disease prevention**.  

Whether it’s analyzing **time-restricted eating patterns** or **decoding patient journeys**, I believe data should tell stories that drive **actionable change**.  

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishawaggeh) or check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aw3743).
